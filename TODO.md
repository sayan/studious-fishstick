- **Demographics**: Age groups, Gender distribution, Minority population
- **Total Records**: ~Booth level data across multiple assembly constituencies

### Key Variables
- **Electoral Performance**: BJP, TMC, LF vote percentages; ValidVotes, Voters2024
- **Demographics**: 
  - Age: P_20 (≤20), P_20_30 (20-30), P_30_40 (30-40), P_40_50 (40-50), P_50_60 (50-60), Above_60 (>60)
